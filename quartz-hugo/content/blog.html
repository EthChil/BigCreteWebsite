                            <p>Hiya neighbour, welcome to the Big Crete Engineering blog. As the first post, this will act as an introduction to Big Crete, who I am, and what to expect from my blog. This will be the first of many blog posts covering a range of topics from my personal life to engineering.</p>

                            <b>What is Big Crete?</b>
                        </div>
                        <div class="text-box">
                            <p>To fully understand what Big Crete is, I first need to give some background on my personal approach to engineering and the role it plays in my life. I have been passionate about engineering for as long as I can remember and is the primary lens through which I view the world. Just a warning what comes next is purely philosophical I am by no means a philosopher so it might just sound like a garbled unintelligible mess.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="text-box">
                            <p>All living things on this planet are faced with hardship and challenge. The downfall for of a finite universe means finite resources and as a result all living creatures will face the challenge this presents. Whether that be predators who see your species as a recourse or the actual materials around you there is always a limit that creatures are trying to push beyond, in the futile goal of infinite population and lifespans. This is the major driver of life on earth and through the process of evolution animals pursue this goal, for humans we are quite the same. Unlike most living beings’ humanity is in a unique position where we can artificially evolve through technology, actively shaping the world around us to improve our conditions and lives at a pace that puts traditional genetic evolution to shame. All people are indebted to those who came before producing the technologies and ideas required to make our lives that much easier and enjoyable. But even where we stand today on the shoulders of giants, we still yearn to break free from the shackles of a finite universe to fill our infinite appetite. Whether or not we will reach this ideal is a different conversation altogether. To me there is nothing more noble someone can do during their time here than to try and contribute to society and help to improve the lives of others not only today but tomorrow and beyond. Scientists, engineers, mathematicians, philosophers, and many others pursue this goal endlessly. To me engineering in it’s purest is leveraging our understanding of the world around us to practically create things that improve the lives of others. That’s not to say that engineering is the only way to pursue this goal, the structure of our society, market systems, culture are all contributors to enabling the world around us. So as much as I hate to say it yes politicians are pursuing the noble goal of better distributing resources to those who need it to enable an improved future for all (at least in theory) in practice this is not always the case. </p>

                        <div class="text-box">
                            <p>There is an adage give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish you feed him for a lifetime. I think we should expand upon this: Engineer the tools for him to catch more than any man before and you feed his town forever (but of course a finite world means eventually you could fish beyond what the ocean supplies). I enjoy my work because it allows me as one person to improve the lives of populations for time to come. The job of the engineer is to be creative and find solutions to the biggest problems we face, ultimately engineers are problem solvers leveraging all the knowledge we have accumulated building things that push humanity forward. </p>

                        <div class="text-box">
                            <p>So, circling this back to Big Crete, my passion for engineering and creating things. You now understand my passion and my drive. Most engineering is done within companies who produce solutions for the world, this means that companies have taken the time to figure out how to brand and become recognizable, we can relate to a company just like how we can relate to individuals. My hope is that branding my projects under the Big Crete name as if it were a company will give it a life bigger than me and maybe lend it more credibility.</p>

                            <p>Well, the name is mostly an inside joke but basically it has nothing to do with engineering and is a slang version of concrete. But from there it has taken on more meaning, combining the name with a construction themed logo is meant to convey what I’m all about which is building things. Just like how concrete is an iconic technology of the modern world we live in, I hope that Big Crete will stand for projects equally as pivotal (unlikely, but a boy can dream).</p>
