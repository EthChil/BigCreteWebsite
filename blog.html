                            <p>To explain this will take some time and explaining my personal philosophy with engineering and the role it plays in my own life. I have been passionate about engineering for as long as I can remember and for me that passion comes from how I approach society and life in general. </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="text-box">
                            <p>All living things on this planet are faced with hardship and challenge. Regardless of situation the nature of a finite universe means that creatures will always face challenge, there will always exist things that lay beyond our reach and all creatures work and strive to overcome these obstacles. Humanity is in a unique position where we can artificially augment the world around us to improve our conditions and lives. All people are indebted to those who came before producing the technologies and shaping the world to make our lives that much easier and enjoyable. But the ideal of goal of perfection for all people will likely always remain beyond our reach. To me despite this there is nothing more noble someone can do during their time here than to try and contribute to society helping to improve the lives of others not today but tomorrow and beyond. Scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and many others pursue this goal endlessly. To me engineering in it’s purest is leveraging our understanding of the world around us to practically create things that improve the lives of others. </p>

                            <p>There is an adage give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish you feed him for a lifetime. I think we should expand upon this, give a man a fish you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish you feed him for a lifetime. Engineer the tools for him to catch beyond his means you feed his town forever. I enjoy my work because it allows me as one person to improve the lives of populations for time to come. The job of the engineer is to be creative and find solutions to the biggest problems we face, ultimately engineers are problem solvers leveraging all the knowledge we have accumulated building things that push humanity forward. </p>

                            <p>So, circling this back to Big Crete, my passion for engineering and creating things. You now understand my passion and my drive, how I feel I can best contribute to society.  Most engineering is done within companies who produce solutions for the world, it is easily memorable and the art of branding something is a form of marketing. Branding my projects under the Big Crete name gives it a form of authenticity for me and is an exercise in creating things that could be products (mind you most of my projects aren’t practical as products) but none the less it’s working to make things closer to real world solutions than purely academic ones.</p>

                            <b>Cool story bro, what about the name?</b>
                        </div>
                        <div class="text-box">
                            <p>Well, the name is mostly an inside joke but basically it has nothing to do with engineering and is a slang version of concrete. But from there it has taken on more meaning, combining the name with a construction themed logo is meant to convey what I’m all about which is building things. Just like how concrete is an iconic technology of the modern world we live in, I hope that Big Crete will stand for projects equally as pivotal (unlikely, but a boy can dream).</p>
