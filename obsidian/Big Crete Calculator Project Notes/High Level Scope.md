V1 - Not really a revision but rather breakout boards for each of the circuits that's not space constrained and easy to debug, this proves out V2
V2 - Using off the shelf FPGA (Alchitry) get a calcualtor as slim as possible working with the minimal scope set above. This will prove out mechanical and electrical integration allowing for digital design iteration paving the way for V3.
V3 - From scratch fully featured calculator with custom FPGA circuit and replaceable RAM
