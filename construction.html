<!-- Ideas for my under construction website -->
<!-- In progress projects each take up the width of the screen and you can scroll through them
     any given one has an image along with a quick descriptor of what it's about-->

<!--modals to implement-->
<!--big crete pcb chip thingy-->
<!--big crete calculator-->
<!--big crete ray tracer-->
<!--bracket bot Big Crete x Big Brocc x Big Clay production-->

<!--
vim things to do
chat app in vim
music player in vim

each one should have the title at the top
- a quick description of what it is
- a quick list of project facts
- a list of upcomming project goals with target dates
- a calendar list of when things were fixed in a journal format with the date it was implented and a writeup about that feature

new idea 
- a construction site with links in the center for the projects which go to dedicated pages for them
maybe its a building and the windows are the project links
- for now just put the links in the center of the screen
