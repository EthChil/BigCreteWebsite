## Overview

The calculator is a humble device and is often a project that early engineers embark on as they learn. Typically this takes the form of whatever discipline they are learning, so for instance an individual learning software may try to program a basic calculator application, a firmware engineer may try to program a calculator onto an ARM processor or equivalent embedded device. I thought what if I truly built a calculator from scratch, the hardware, the mechanical, the software, even down to the digital architecture. This is the dream behind the big crete calculator, a project that requires me to design from the minutia of transistors to material properties of the larger structure.
