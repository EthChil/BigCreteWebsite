title: "Big Crete Fidget Cube"

[Return to Projects](main.html)

Closely based on the popular 3D printed fidget cube I modified the design for machining and manually machined it out of brass over the course of a couple days. The final design weight half a killogram and consists of solid brass. It's much harder to use than it's 3D printed counterpart but in my opinion is much cooler.
