Hiya neighbour, welcome to the Big Crete Engineering blog. As the first post, this will act as an introduction to Big Crete, 
who I am, and what to expect from my blog. This will be the first of many blog posts covering a range of topics from my 
personal life to engineering.

### What is Big Crete?

To fully understand what Big Crete is, I first need to give some background on my personal approach to engineering and 
the role it plays in my life. I have been passionate about engineering for as long as I can remember and is the primary 
lens through which I view the world. Just a warning what comes next is purely philosophical I am by no means a 
philosopher so it might just sound like a garbled unintelligible mess.

All living things on this planet are faced with hardship and challenge. The downfall for of a finite universe means 
finite resources and as a result all living creatures will face the challenge this presents. Whether that be predators 
who see your species as a recourse or the actual materials around you there is always a limit that creatures are trying 
to push beyond, in the futile goal of infinite population and lifespans. This is the major driver of life on earth and 
through the process of evolution animals pursue this goal, for humans we are quite the same. Unlike most living beings’ 
humanity is in a unique position where we can artificially evolve through technology, actively shaping the world around
us to improve our conditions and lives at a pace that puts traditional genetic evolution to shame. All people are 
indebted to those who came before producing the technologies and ideas required to make our lives that much easier and 
enjoyable. But even where we stand today on the shoulders of giants, we still yearn to break free from the shackles of 
a finite universe to fill our infinite appetite. Whether or not we will reach this ideal is a different conversation
altogether. To me there is nothing more noble someone can do during their time here than to try and contribute to 
society and help to improve the lives of others not only today but tomorrow and beyond. Scientists, engineers, 
mathematicians, philosophers, and many others pursue this goal endlessly. To me engineering in it’s purest is leveraging 
our understanding of the world around us to practically create things that improve the lives of others. That’s not to 
say that engineering is the only way to pursue this goal, the structure of our society, market systems, culture are all 
contributors to enabling the world around us. So as much as I hate to say it yes politicians are pursuing the noble goal 
of better distributing resources to those who need it to enable an improved future for all (at least in theory) in 
practice this is not always the case.

There is an adage give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish you feed him for a lifetime. 
I think we should expand upon this: Engineer the tools for him to catch more than any man before and you feed his town 
forever (but of course a finite world means eventually you could fish beyond what the ocean supplies). I enjoy my work 
because it allows me as one person to improve the lives of populations for time to come. The job of the engineer is to 
be creative and find solutions to the biggest problems we face, ultimately engineers are problem solvers leveraging all 
the knowledge we have accumulated building things that push humanity forward.

So, circling this back to Big Crete, my passion for engineering and creating things. You now understand my passion and 
my drive. Most engineering is done within companies who produce solutions for the world, this means that companies have 
taken the time to figure out how to brand and become recognizable, we can relate to a company just like how we can 
relate to individuals. My hope is that branding my projects under the Big Crete name as if it were a company will give 
it a life bigger than me and maybe lend it more credibility.

### Cool story bro, what about the name?
Well, the name is mostly an inside joke but basically it has nothing to do with engineering and is a slang version of 
concrete. But from there it has taken on more meaning, combining the name with a construction themed logo is meant to 
convey what I’m all about which is building things. Just like how concrete is an iconic technology of the modern world 
we live in, I hope that Big Crete will stand for projects equally as pivotal (unlikely, but a boy can dream).

I also want to thank [Clayton Haight](https://clayhaight.com) who graciously open sourced his blog format and agreed to let me 
use it for my own. So, if you are interested in making your own blog and want an easy starting point to feel free to 
copy this format but make sure to credit Clayton not myself.

So welcome to Big Crete, make yourself at home and be sure to check in often and feel free to reach out, I’d love to chat.
