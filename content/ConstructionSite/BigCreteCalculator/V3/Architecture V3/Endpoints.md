**Power Endpoints

- FPGA 

Internal Rails
3.3V @ 3.5A
1.8V @ 1.4A
1.35V @ 1.2A
1V @ 2.2A

This is 17.89W

The board wants 5V input which corresponds to 3.578A (lets call it 3.5A)

- Display

3v3 @ 5mA
5v @ 30mA


- LEDs

Drive these off the 5V rail, unclear current draw budget an amp?


Power infrastructure
5A @ 5V (25W)
0.5A @ 3v3
