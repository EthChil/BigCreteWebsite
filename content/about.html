                <p class="job-description">Neuralink is developing the future of BCIs pushing them to the mainstream. I took ownership on 2 main projects Emulation and AMS with some digital design on the side. For Emulation I built a system to allow us to emulate the upcoming S1 chip on an FPGA providing verificaiton for the digital design including core along with the tooling the firmware team needed to iterate quickly prior to tapeout. For AMS I built out the tooling and testbenches on both the digital and analog side required to validate S1. In addition to this I did RTL design for portions of the S1 digital design. </p>

                <p class="job-description">Across my 8 months at Canadensys I worked on a wide array of projects. Initially I worked on their first set of NISA lunar cameras developing tooling required to speed up assembly and also documentation for how to assemble them. I designed and built vibration plates, clean room equipment, firmware loading automation, a custom ICT to validate the electronics, and personally assembled the first set sold to customers some of which are now on orbit. During my final 4 months I switched from NISA to working on their satellite avionic computers where I developed FPGA programs helped to bring up the first batch and develop similar assembly procedures.</p>

            <p class="text-box">I am a 4th year Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I have a vast set of interests across engineering disciplines and like to keep myself busy. I just wrapped up my coop term at <a href="https://neuralink.com/">Neuralink</a> as an ASIC Design intern, working on a next generation chip for a future generation brain implant. Some topics that interest me deeply are chip design, electrical engineering, control theory, materials, and physics.</p>

                <p>I love to learn both in the class and outside of it. I work on a variety of projects and this website acts as a place for me to show them off. For complete projects you can visit my <a href="main.html">projects</a> page and for projects I'm working go to the <a href="construction.html">construction site</a>. I am currently working on exploring the world of chip design a common theme is my fascination with the miniature the amount of engineering squeezed into the small space of many chips inspires me.</p>

                <p>I love to work on things from first principles learning and developing the skills to build things myself. I find a deep appreciation in learning how the world around me works and using this knowledge to create cool things. I love fast paced environments where engineering is core to the work being done.</p>

            <p class="text-box">Aside from engineering and projects, I love to get out and explore the world. I love to travel and see the outdoors, I try to seek out new experiences and do things outside of my comfort zone. As for sports I do right now I love hiking, skiing, swimming, and longboarding.</p>
