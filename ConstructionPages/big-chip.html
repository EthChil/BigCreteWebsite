<h1>Big Crete Big Chip</h1>

<div style="width: 100%;">
    <div class="left"> 
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Big Crete Big Chip or just Big Chip for short is an idea I had of a great way to learn chip design and digital design concepts at low cost. ASIC design is very comparable to PCB design in many ways therefore why not just design a PCB the same way we design chips? This goal of this project is to build custom EDA tools to allow me to build digital designs into gerbers which can be manufactured into PCBs with IC logic gates on them.</p>

        <h2>Target Specs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Verilog HDL as input to describe logic</li>
            <li>Outputs any number of square stacked PCBs to build logic</li>
            <li>Uses XOR, OR, AND, NAND, INV, DFF 4 unit ICs only</li>
            <li>Configurable routing fabric and board dimensions</li>
            <li>Open Source or custom synthesizers and routers for layout</li>
        </ul>
