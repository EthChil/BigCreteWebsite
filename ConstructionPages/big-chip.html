<h1>Big Crete Big Chip</h1>

<div style="width: 100%;">
    <div class="left"> 
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Big Crete Big Chip or just Big Chip for short is an idea I had of a great way to learn chip design and digital design concepts at low cost. ASIC design is very comparable to PCB design in many ways therefore why not just design a PCB the same way we design chips? This goal of this project is to build custom EDA tools to allow me to build digital designs into gerbers which can be manufactured into PCBs with IC logic gates on them.</p>

        <h2>Target Specs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Verilog HDL as input to describe logic</li>
            <li>Outputs any number of square stacked PCBs to build logic</li>
            <li>Uses XOR, OR, AND, NAND, INV, DFF 4 unit ICs only</li>
            <li>Configurable routing fabric and board dimensions</li>
            <li>Open Source or custom synthesizers and routers for layout</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

<h2>Project Journal</h2>
<h3>First Layout - December 2022 (projected)</h3>
<h3>Generated Cell Library - December 2022 (projected)</h3>
<h3>Investigate VTR open source router - December 2022 (projected)</h3>
<h3>Cells and interconnect - April 2022</h3>
<p>With a rudimentry gerber generator the next question is how the board will be laid out, I am thinking of using pre routed cells for the logic groups with fixed locations that wires connect to standardized between all cells then with vertical and horizontal interconnect tracks any connection can be made. The thought is that on the top layer are vertical tracks and horizontal tracks are on the bottom layer and the direction can be changed by placing a via. This will restrict and vertical or horizontal conductor to be fixed to that signals but that's a reasonable constraint for now I think.</p>
<h3>Robust Gerber Generation - April 2022</h3>
<p>Read through the Gerber standard and discovered how basic it is basically painting shapes around to generate patterns. I then looked for libraries that implement gerber generation in python and found nothing good so I built my own.</p>
